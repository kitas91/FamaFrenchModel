Abstract: 
Modern portfolio theory deals with the selection of portfolios that maximize expected returns for a pre-established level of risk. 

The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) of William Sharpe (1964) and John Lintner (1965) marks the birth of asset pricing theory resulting in a Nobel Prize for Sharpe in 1990. 

The attraction of the CAPM is that it offers a powerful and intuitively pleasing predictions about how to measure risk and the relation between expected return and risk. Unfortunately, the empirical record of the model is poor due to its simplifying assumptions.  

Capital market theory deals with the effects of investor decisions on security prices. More specifically, it shows the relationship that should exist between security risk and returns if investors constructed portfolios as indicated by modern portfolio theory. 

Together, modern portfolio theory and capital market theory provide a framework to specify and measure investment risk and to develop relationships between expected security return and risk. 

Investors have used a variety of definitions of risk. Professor Harry Markowitz changed how the investment community thought about risk by quantifying the concept of risk. He defined risk in terms of variance. 



Using quantitative models and historical data, modern portfolio theory defines “expected portfolio returns” and “acceptable levels of portfolio risk”, and shows how to construct an “optimal portfolio”.
